        This little bit of code is entirely dedicated to you, Jeremy.
        <br>
        I made it because I really want to make something that's significant for your 30th birthday.
        <br>
        Something that's truly my way of expressing feelings.
        <br>
        I guess it's my way of pouring my art out, because your friendship means so much to me.
        <br>
        You're so fucking impressively smart, intellectually and emotionally,
        and although your modest about it, we all feel it in your dedication to your craft and to your loved ones.
        <br>
        I miss you a lot from all the way over here, but I'm glad that we can still be close.
        <br>
        I am proud to know you and to be your friend,
        <br> and to call you my brother.
        <br>
        <br>
        This script attempts to make a maze out of text, where the words end up being traced in the maze.
        <br>
        I think it's fitting that you can reach the end without coloring all the text, but you can still kind of see the
        whole text. I think it kind of says something
        about life, maybe.
        <br>
        Add a ? to start adding arguments, which must be separated from each other with &.
        <br>
        The loading you saw when you arrived on this site was actually kind of fake.
        <br>
        You can see the process behind it and customize it by adding arguments to the address bar:
        <br>
        <br>
        If you add "text=hello", it will write "hello".
        <br>
        If you add "makingOf=true", it will remove the loading screen so you can see how the maze is made.
        <br>
